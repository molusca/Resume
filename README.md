### Hello! Welcome to my Resume 👋

[Read in Portuguese | Ler em Português](https://github.com/molusca/Front-End/blob/master/resume/README.pt.md)

#### 🕵️‍♂️ About this project:
At the beginning of the quarantine (03/2020) I decided to learn something new, and the programming touched me in a way that I could never imagine. I started to study and have accumulated a lot of cool learning background, but I needed a way to show it to the world

I never really liked the presentation of a conventional resume, it seems boring and not so dynamic... so I made this an opportunity! I decided to learn Front-End to turn my resume into a beautiful and presentable website, with everything relevant there for everyone to reach!

#### 👨‍💻 Status (85%):
I deployed a version that needs some changes, so I can simulate real code refactoring projects and train my ability to define and meet objectives. Points to attack:
- [x] Implement CSS Architecture
- [x] Complete site body
- [x] Hyperlinks and redirects
- [x] Apply color pallete
- [x] Remake Skills section
- [x] Remake Professional Exp. section (REMOVED - Reason: Didn't fit with project context anymore)
- [ ] HTML code maintenance (semantics e accessibility)
- [ ] Performance imporvements 



#### Requirements and how to access:

- It is possible to access in desktop and mobile;
- You'll only need a browser (Chrome, Firefox, Opera etc.);
- Just download the archives and open `index.html` with your browser.
- [Click here]() if you just want to access the site, despite the code
